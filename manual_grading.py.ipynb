      "A similarity that I found interesting between the two readings, \"Getting in\" by Gladwell, and \"Selection from Suicide\" by Durkheim is the subject of Jews. As a Jew, I sometimes find myself questioning why it is that the Jewish religion and its peoples are treated more so as a race, than a religion - similarly to how followers of Islam are seen by some today. Anti-Semitism has been prominent for thousands of years and can be seen throughout history. For example, in \"Getting in\" by Gladwell, Harvard actively came up with and executed ways to keep Jews from attending their university because they were thought to be \"sickly and grasping, grade-grubbing and insular\" (2). Harvard actually grouped students into different groupings in order to determine whether or not they were Jewish. So I asked myself, how is racism against African-Americans, Muslims, Jews or any religion or race different? And the answer is it is not. Racism is racism. And sadly, we live in a world where people see race or religion as a definition of a person where in reality we are all humans, we are all the same, despite our appearances or beliefs. Similarly, in \"Selection from Suicide\" many assertions made my Durkheim sound Anti-Semitic and are false. For example, Durkheim's reasoning for Jews having the lowest rate of suicide when compared to other religions is because, \"Judaism, in fact, like all early religions, consists basically of a body of practices minutely governing all the details of life and leaving free room to individual judgment\" (160). This statement is completely false. One of Judaism's central ideas is that of the individual and acceptance of all. Additionally, Durkheim's diction here and elsewhere changes from an intellectual prose to an almost astute prose when discussing Jews. \"Besides, it must be remembered that Jews live more exclusively than other confessional groups\" (155).\n",

      "In \"Suicide: A Study in Sociology\", Emile Durkheim investigates the mystery behind the exceptionally low rates of suicide among groups of Jews. The conclusion of his research provides me with a fresh point of view when it comes to suicide and mental problem. \n",
      "After testing several hypotheses regarding the prevalence of the confession and the system of religion, Durkheim comes to the conclusion that \"the more numerous and strong these collective states of mind are, the stronger the integration of the religious community and also the greater is preservative value\" (Lecture, 08/31/16). This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Jewish communities are often small and very tight-knit as they have to face constant abhorrence from others. \n",
      "Durkheim's finding is surprising to me as I have always thought that those who belong to minorities and face discrimination are the most likely to commit suicide. They often feel stressed because their voices are not heard and they are not valued enough. This inescapable struggle, in most cases that I have observed in real life, does not make them feel immune to abhorrence and \"[abandon] the idea of conciliating [the hostility]\" but rather, makes them feel inferior and implanted with negative thoughts (Durkheim, 157). Eventually they decide to end it as suicide seems to be \"too little an object of public condemnation\" and \"an act without offense to others\" (Durkheim, 156).\n",

      "\tHours after discussing the sociological impact of college admissions, I was scrolling through my Facebook newsfeed - looking at the headlines I know are catered to my previous likes and interests - and I noticed a headline about a lawsuit against Ivy League institutions. Reading further, I learned that the head of a coalition of Asian Americans for education, who also is a father of an undergraduate applicant sued multiple Ivy League institutions earlier in 2016 for some of the very reasons that were discussed on behalf of Jews by Malcom Gladwell in 2005. Although the groups at the center of the debate have changed, many of the trends and concerns seem to be similar. \n",
      "\tFor example, some of the interesting points in the Gladwell article Getting In, discussed the discrimination by Ivy League institutions against Jewish people, and the system of graduate based admission as a method of discrimination without setting quotas. The natural progression of thought compares the social theories for both situations. Is it possible that the graduate-based system of admission still exists, but in bias towards a different group, despite the advertised blind and impartial process?  Furthermore, what would the basis of prediction of graduate success be - especially in light of so many successful Asian American academics and innovators? Although the soundness of the lawsuit is still under consideration, it is interesting to observe the parallels and similarities of the enigma of Ivy League decisions.\n"
